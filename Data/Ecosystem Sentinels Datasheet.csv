include both generalist (e.g., great tit [Parus major]) and specialist
(e.g., coal tit [Periparus ater]) species (del Hoyo et al., 2007), suggesting
that their ecology overlaps with many other forest bird species
and that titmice could serve as an indicator group for bird density
in forest habitats in general. Additionally, titmice are conspicuous
due to their highly active foraging, social, and vocal behavior (del
Hoyo et al., 2007), making them easy to observe. As a group, titmice
are often easily recognized by the general public due to their highly
similar appearance across species (del Hoyo et al., 2007) and their
common visits to garden bird feeders. Additionally, identifying individuals
to species level is mainly easy due to the variation of plumage
color (Eck & Martens, 2006; del Hoyo et al., 2007), body size (Alatalo
& Moreno, 1987; Eck & Martens, 2006; del Hoyo et al., 2007), and
crestedness among species (Eck & Martens, 2006; del Hoyo et al.,
2007). Overall, the ecology of titmice makes them potentially a more
efficient indicator group for forest bird abundance than, for example,
woodpeckers or cuckoos, which are less abundant and diverse
and consist of mainly specialist species""",1,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
